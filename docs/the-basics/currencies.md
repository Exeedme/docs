# Currencies

## Ethereum

**Ethereum** (ETH) provides a **[cryptocurrency](introduction#what-is-cryptocurrency)** token called “Ether”, the gas for its own network. **Ethereum** is a distributed blockchain based platform that runs smart contracts. This technology enables the system to move value, store and process transactions and data, and provide safe exchange of valuable information between its users, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.

## Bitcoin

Essentially, it is a digital token that can be exchanged electronically. It does not exist in physical form. **Bitcoins** are created and kept track of by a **[Blockchain](introduction#what-is-blockchain)** which is a network of computers using complex mathematical formulas, rather than by a single authority or organisation.
