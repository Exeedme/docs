# Overview

## Specifics

Lottery Ticket Fee for 1 ticket: 5 **[$XED](/docs/get-started/xed-vs-exe#what-is-xed)**
Single User Lottery Entry Limit: Limited to 4 entries, but each entry can have any number of tickets.

Paying for one ticket will give users a random ticket number, which corresponds to its position in the overall tickets list.

## How to win

To win the lottery prize, participants need one of their tickets to be one of the 5 winning tickets. That entitles you to receive 20% of the 5000 $XED prize pool

## Lottery period

The lottery will run for 2 weeks, after which the winners will be drawn. It will be open from 12-05-2021 at 08:50 GMT to 26-05-2021 at 10:00 GMT

## How are winning tickets drawn?

The lottery aims to be completely random. The ticket numbers given out are determined by a first come first served order. When drawing the winning tickets, the lottery makes use of the [Cainlink's VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/) capabilities, which provides it with a true source of randomness, which in turn is used to derive the winners.

## Cashback

For this lottery, we decided to give you **[$EXEs](/docs/get-started/xed-vs-exe#what-is-exe)** (Exeedme platform's currency) back for all the tickets you buy. For this, we take into account the current $XED rate and convert it to $EXEs (100 $EXEs = 1 $USD).
To get this cashback, you will need an Exeedme account
