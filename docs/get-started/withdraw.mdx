# Withdraw

If you are a real winner and are achieving some great results, you may want to convert your EXEs into Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, or XED. Every withdrawal will suffer a small deduction, the estimated network fees of each transaction. Again, here, if you opt for USDT (TRC20), the transaction fees can be significantly lowered.

  There's a daily withdrawal limit of <b>10000EXEs</b> ($100).
