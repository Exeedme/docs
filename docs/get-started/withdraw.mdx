# Withdraw

If you are a real winner and are achieving some great results, you may want to convert your USDX into Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, or XED. Every withdrawal will suffer a small deduction, the estimated network fees of each transaction. Again, here, if you opt for USDT (TRC20), the transaction fees can be significantly lowered.

There's a daily withdrawal limit of **1000USDX**. You have to verify your account and it has to be at least one week old.
