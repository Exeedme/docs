# Play

It's time for you to play your first game. In **Exeedme** we have a lot of options for you to start playing.

## Custom Lobbies

![available game modes](/img/platform/custom_lobbies.png)

The Exeedme custom lobbies allow you to play with your friends with just a few clicks. There are currently 3 game modes available:

- 1vs1
- 2vs2
- 5vs5

They all work the same way. Simply select the game mode and choose a server region (EU and NA for now), and a bet amount in EXEs. After that the lobby is created and you can start inviting your friends.
