# Video Referee

At Exeedme we take cheating very seriously. One of the ways we fight it is with the **Video Referee**.

The video-referee system is a new system implemented by us, where a selected list of competent video-referees can earn by analysing suspicious matches reported by players. Whenever thereâ€™s evident proof, there will be convictions.

To request a video referee review, simply go to the page of the lobby and click on the red icon next to the player you want to report.

  marginBottom="16px"

A modal will appear with some info that you should take into account.

:::note
Our video referee system has a cost of **5USDX** in the first 30 minutes
after the game, and **10USDX** after that. This amount will be reverted
to you if the video referee considers the accused player to be cheating.
