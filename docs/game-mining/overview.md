# Overview

The Exeedme Game Mining program is finally here. Every user on the platform is eligible to participate, all it takes is to stake your $XED on our platform, and start reaping your rewards right away. The more games you play at Exeedme, the more you earn.


## What is the Game Mining program?

One of our most awaited features that truly embodies the Play to Earn spirit because it allows users to earn while they play at Exeedme, regardless of the outcome of the game.

It is a direct incentive that rewards loyal and active members who are helping us drive adoption by playing games at Exeedme. All you need is to stake the minimum amount of **400 $XED** tokens on our platform and from then on, for each game you play, we reward you with **1% of match wager in $XED tokens**. 


:::info What is Staking?

Simply put, staking is the act of **locking your $XED tokens on the platform, for a period of time, to receive rewards**. These rewards are attributed to the user in several ways, ranging from receiving $XED tokens as a reward, to receiving access to exclusive platform features, such as competitions, tournaments and one-of-a-kind NFT’s.
