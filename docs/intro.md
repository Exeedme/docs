# Exeedme Intro

Exeedme was founded with the intention of creating a platform that would enable gamers to monetize their playing time, regardless of skill level. Our company’s strategy is geared towards shifting focus from the industry’s current standard business model, Free2Play (which consists of purportedly offering games for free and then generating revenue through in-game purchases), to a Play2Earn philosophy, powered by blockchain technology.

In this docs you will find everything you need to know to make the most out of the platform.
