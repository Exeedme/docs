## What is staking?

Staking is the act of locking your $XED tokens to receive rewards after a predetermined time. They still **belong to you** during
the whole staking period and **you are always in control** if you want to take them back or not.

## How can I stake my tokens?

On the first 10 days after the staking pools are live, you can get in at any time. Just keep in mind that after this deadline
the pools will be closed and no further deposits can be made.

Follow our [guide](/docs/staking/how-to-stake) to know how you can stake your XEDs.

## When can I withdraw my tokens?

After entering a pool, you can withdraw your funds at any time. **Really!** Your funds are always in your control.

But to get those sweet rewards you will need to wait some time.
So, the only consequences of withdrawing are related to the amount of yield you receive back.

## How are staking rewards calculated?

For each of the pools, there are three reward steps, each corresponding to the withdraw phases.

First of all, if you withdraw before the _Early Withdraw_ time, you will get your tokens back, with no extra accumulated yield.

After this and before the _Full Maturity_ time, you can withdraw your funds with the _Early Withdraw_ APY.

Lastly, if you wait like a champion for the total duration of the staking period, you will receive the max rewards. Just don't
forget to claim your tokens. Either way, they will forever be waiting for you.

:::note
Keep in mind that withdrawing right after the **Early Withdraw** gives you the same rewards as withdrawing right before the **Full Maturity**. The same is valid for the **Full Maturity**.

Rewards do not increase through time.
